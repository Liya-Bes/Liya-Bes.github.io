## Project description

Using C++ we recreated the Battleship game. The player is going to be playing against the AI controlled enemy. The game is locating and destroying the enemy's ship before they destroy your ship. We used procedural programming principles and C++ fundementals.   

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
# Compile the program
g++ Battleship.cpp -o battleship

# Run the program
./battleship
```

## UI Design

We used terminal to run the game. The user inputs what coordinates they would like to attack and get either hit or miss text depending if they hit or miss. They would also be able to view what places they have succesfully hit and what they have missed by updating the game board after each play.
