    <h1>Creating Ethernet Cables</h1>

    <h2>What is an Ethernet Cable?</h2>
    <p>An Ethernet cable is a special wire that helps computers talk to each other.</p>
        <p>It is used to connect computers to the internet or to each other. The cable sends data back and forth really fast. It is often used in schools, homes, and offices to go online.</p>
    <h2>How We Made the Cables</h2>
    <p>Each person in our group made two Ethernet cables. First, we got the wire, cut it to the right length, and carefully stripped off the plastic cover.</p>
        <p>Then, we placed the tiny colored wires in the correct order and pushed them into a plastic connector. Last, we used a crimping tool to press the wires in tight.</p>
    <h2>How We Tested the Cables</h2>
    <p>After making the cables, we used a tool called a cable tester. This tool tells us if the wires inside are working.</p>
        <p>If the lights on the tester flash the right way, the cable is good! We also plugged the cables into a computer and checked if we could go online. All of our cables worked!</p>
    <h2>Labeling the Cables</h2>
    <p>To make sure we know which cable belongs to who, we wrote our initials on the ends of each cable using a black permanent marker.</p>
