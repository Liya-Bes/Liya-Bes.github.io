## Project description

This project we made the classic poular game Snake Game using Java. We used terminal to run it. The game is basically making sure the snake doesnt die by crashing in to a wall or itself. It also grows whenever it eats the apple. The key features include snake movement via keyboard input, score tracking, detection when the snake dies and the game is over. 

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/csu-cs/SnakeGame
cd SnakeGame

#once under the src directory we have to compile all java file
javac src/csu/csci325/*.java

# we will run the main program
java csu.csci325.Main
```

## UI Design

This is a terminal game and the user plays the game using the keyboard. The UI consists of game grid, score board, apple and the snake as well as a message telling the user if the game is paused, over or instruction to start the game.

## 3. Additional Considerations

The game is a one player game but it can be imporved by adding a timer, comparing previous score to new score, and adding multiple players.
