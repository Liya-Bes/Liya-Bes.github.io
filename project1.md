## Project description

This is a full walkthrough and instructional website that demonstrates the steps of building physical computer network. It also descirbes and shows how network is built, how computers communicate and what we need to build a network like cables, testers and routers. The website includes videos, images and explanation of every step we took. It includes:
    - creating ethernet cable
    - installing a samba server
    - constructing a LAN using one router
    - constructing a LAN using two router
    - running tests and analyzing results 

## How to view and run the program

This project doesn't require compilation. It can be viewed online by visiting the hosted site https://Liya-Bes.github.io/project1-site/index.html 

## UI Design

The website is designed to guide the user theough each section of the networking process. It have different section and uses step by step explanation for each step for example cable creation, using real photos of the LAN setup, routers and cable testers. It also includes visual indicators showing the cable testers and how to use and read the results as well as oe router and two router LAN setup and their difference. 


## 3. Additional Considerations

While doing this project we learnt so many things. Mainly how ethernet cables are made, how samba enables file sharing accross network, how to troubleshoot connection failure and also how to document different steps we take and how we need them later on. As a curious person who used to wonder how airdroppig and sharing workss this project taught me and gave me a smaller picture of how everything works together.
