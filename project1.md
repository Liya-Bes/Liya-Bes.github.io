    - creating ethernet cable
    - installing a samba server
    - constructing a LAN using one router
    - constructing a LAN using two router

## How to view and run the program

This project doesn't require compilation. It can be viewed online by visiting the hosted site https://Liya-Bes.github.io/project1-site/index.html 

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
